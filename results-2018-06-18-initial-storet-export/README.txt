These are the results of making export files of the STORET data that had been uploaded by KF and
had never been checked before.

Summary:

There are 9 situations where the date information is wrong in either the field data, the nutrient data or both.  Sometimes the ActivityStartDate column does not agree the date encoded in the ActivityIdentifier.

Of the 420 samples in the STORET, 113 have the incorrect time.  Sometimes whole sample days have the same time.

Includes sessions 1-22 and 27, with 23-26 missing. (2016-06-14 through 2017-06-01, then a gap until 2017-09-12)

Many Ammonia measurements were not included because they were below detectable levels.  This does not make them a bad measurement.

There are some samples that have differences in the last digit of precision. Not critical, but why?
ex:
DO	6.07	6.06 DIFF

There are some measurements with extra digits beyond the last digit of precision.  Not critical, but why? Ex:
TotalN	109.54	109.540884307262 DIFF
