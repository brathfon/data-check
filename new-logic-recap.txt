Replaced some of the logic to handle samples only in one file and not in another and empty samples, which are
when the row is empty. This would allow me to get high level counts. It would also only compare
the ones in common after reporting the high level information and then when comparing the ones in common,
report if either is empty. So looks good:

A is Dana's data, B is fixed webexport-2-5-2018

A: 656 entries
B: 642 entries

20: A only    636 in common    6: B only

Comparing results: did not report as many empties because all empties were in Dana's data, so not in common.


Another check: original webexport data, no fixes, from 2-5


45: A only   611 in common   31: B only

Same diffs.
