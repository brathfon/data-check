This directory has in delivery information from making the first delivery of a webexport after
combining Dana's and Kim's data and exhaustively checking any differences between the data sheets.
It was not generated from the mySQL database.  It's results were used to create the legacy data
that was used in the database initial population.  After this, the web export files were created
by populating the database with this legacy data, exports from the Google Drive sheets, and
SOEST spreadsheets that were parsed.
